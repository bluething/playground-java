### Bubble Sort

* How it works: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order
* Time Complexity: O(n²) average and worst case, O(n) best case
* Space Complexity: O(1)
* Stability: Stable
* Best for: Small datasets or nearly sorted data

### Selection Sort

* How it works: Divides the array into sorted and unsorted regions, repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region
* Time Complexity: O(n²) for all cases
* Space Complexity: O(1)
* Stability: Not stable
* Best for: Small datasets where memory is limited
